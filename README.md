# Handwritten-Digit-Generator-GAN-Based
The Handwritten Digit Generator is an AI-powered application that uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize realistic images of handwritten digits, similar to those in the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the creative side of machine learning by generating new image data from scratch using two key models
